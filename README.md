# aws-website-uptime-monitor
A cost-efficient, serverless website monitoring and alerting system built with AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS.

# 🌐 AWS Serverless Website Uptime MonitorBuilt By: [Your Name/Handle] | Status: ✅ Active (Production Ready)🚀 Project OverviewThis project implements a highly available, cost-optimized, and fully serverless solution on AWS to perform scheduled health checks on a target URL. It ensures business continuity by providing real-time alerting the moment a service failure is detected.This architecture validates proficiency in core AWS serverless services, infrastructure automation, and robust monitoring practices.🏛️ Architecture and Data FlowThe monitoring solution is built using five core AWS services, forming a highly efficient event-driven pipeline.AWS ServiceRole in the ProjectKey Skill DemonstratedAWS LambdaThe Worker: Executes the Python-based HTTP/S health check logic.Serverless Compute, Boto3 SDK, Exception Handling (Timeouts, Network Errors).Amazon EventBridgeThe Scheduler: Triggers the Lambda function reliably every 5 minutes using a rate expression.Infrastructure Automation, Event-Driven Architecture.Amazon SNSThe Alerting System: Publishes critical failure messages, instantly notifying subscribers (via email) when a website is down.Real-Time Communications, Alerting Configuration.Amazon DynamoDBThe Persistence Layer: Records detailed logs of all failure events (timestamp, status code, error message) for historical analysis and reporting.NoSQL Database Management, Data Modeling for Event Logging.Amazon CloudWatchThe Observer: Collects logs (CloudWatch Logs) and monitors Lambda execution metrics, ensuring the system itself is healthy.Comprehensive Monitoring, Observability.⚙️ Technical Deep Dive & Key LearningsThis section highlights the specific technical choices that demonstrate best practices:Cost Efficiency (Serverless First): By choosing Lambda and EventBridge, the solution operates entirely within the AWS Free Tier for typical usage, incurring costs only during execution time (milliseconds), eliminating the overhead and cost of dedicated EC2 instances.Secure Execution: Implemented a fine-grained IAM Role for the Lambda function, strictly enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege. The role only allows write access to its designated DynamoDB table and publishing to the SNS topic.Resilience & Error Handling: The Python code within Lambda is configured to specifically catch HTTPError and URLError exceptions, distinguishing between application-level failures (e.g., 500 status codes) and network/DNS/timeout failures, providing precise alert information.Configuration as Environment Variables: All sensitive configuration data (Target URL, SNS ARN) is passed securely to the Lambda function via Environment Variables, separating configuration from code logic.🛠️ Quick Setup GuideTo replicate this environment:Dependencies: Ensure Python 3.x and the Boto3 SDK are available.AWS Console Steps:Create a DynamoDB table (UptimeMonitorResults) with target_url as the Partition Key.Create an SNS Topic (UptimeAlertsTopic) and subscribe your email.Deploy the lambda_function.py code to a Lambda function with the required IAM Role.Configure the TARGET_URL, SNS_TOPIC_ARN, and DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME as environment variables.Create an EventBridge Rule to trigger the Lambda every 5 minutes.
